## Proven result 1: dual-source compression

The theorem in

```text
literature/proofs/AK3_DUAL_SOURCE_COMPRESSION.md
```

allows two stabilizing relations \(z^{-1}w_z,t^{-1}w_t\) to compress both
source relators before either old generator is removed.  A triangular pair
of unique-occurrence equations removes the two old generators in order.
More generally, if the two compressed source relators form a primitive pair
in \(F_4\), a proved rank-\(n\) stable ambient automorphism straightens and
removes them; the quotient pair is well-defined up to Aut(\(F_2\)).

The exact AK(3) data

```text
w_z = X
w_t = Xy
I_R = TZxYYY
I_S = TZtxYX
```

give

```text
y = XTZtx
x = TZZZtzt
```

and the stable endpoint

```text
XYXYxxxy | YYXYxxYXyxy
```

with complete Whitehead representative

```text
YYXXXyx | YYXXXYxyX
```

of total length 16.  The exact identities, both eliminations, endpoint, and
Aut-floor are pinned by
`tests/stable_ac/test_dual_source_compression.py`.

This is a new stable corridor, not a trivialization.

## Proven result 2: arbitrary relative conjugators

At the one-stabilization compression root, write

```text
A = xxxzXXXXZ
B = ZxzxZ
```

The theorem in

```text
literature/proofs/AK3_ARBITRARY_CONJUGATOR_PRIMITIVE_BARRIER.md
```

proves that no target

\[
 A cB^{\pm1}c^{-1}
 \quad\text{or}\quad
 B cA^{\pm1}c^{-1},
 \qquad c\in F(x,z),
\]

is primitive.

The proof is not a bounded conjugator census.  A Cayley-tree axis lemma
reduces the minimum over every relative conjugator to a finite product of
cyclic rotations.  All four signed cases have minimum cyclic length 10.
Their abelianization slopes are \(\pm(1,-1)\) or \(\pm(3,-1)\), while the
rank-two primitive-word classification would force lengths 2 or 4.

Thus no one arbitrary-conjugator multiplication from this compression orbit
creates the decisive primitive-relator shortcut.  The exact rotation table
is pinned by
`tests/stable_ac/test_arbitrary_conjugator_primitive_barrier.py`.

This remains local in the number of multiplications.  It does not bound the
Aut-floor of every child and is not a stable-AC obstruction.

## Live lead

The strongest remaining direct mechanism is primitive-pair compression
before either old generator is removed.  Short templates produce the
floor-16 corridor above.  A broader visible-block pass returned only to
AK(3)'s floor-13 classical class, but that finite observation remains
unverified.

The target is a hidden-cancellation or longer \(F_4\) primitive pair whose
rank-two quotient has complete Aut-floor at most 12.  A primitive full
four-relator tuple would be an immediate stable solve.

AK(3) remains open.
