# Lessons Learned

### 2026-07-14 Equivalence tutorial verification environment

- [TRAP] This checkout has no `ACSolverX/.venv/bin/python3`; commands copied from the proof-book documentation fail here.
- [WORKS] Run the independent certificate verifier without modifying the project environment via `uv run --with numba --with numpy python3 <absolute-path>/experiments/equivalence_classes/verify/verify_proofs.py`.
- [WORKS] Pass absolute input and output paths to Tectonic in this workspace; relative `--outdir` resolution was unreliable.

### 2026-07-14 CoV best-z: allow pure powers later

- [DEFERRED] Best-z / length-sweep should eventually allow pure-power `z` (`xx`, `yy`, …). First-z (`NAIVE_Z_FAMILY`) stays mixed-only so pure powers do not preempt the picker.
- Current pipeline: best-z candidates come from the presentation's own relator subwords (`subword_candidates` / `enumerate_cov`); that path still filters `len({abs(g)}) < 2`. Do not implement the pure-power change until asked.

### 2026-07-24 Research-loop terminal condition

- [TRAP] A rigorous bounded negative or an honest intermediate theorem is not completion when the user requested a proof-resolution loop.
- [WORKS] Treat each bounded result as one proof attempt: understand the remaining gap, formulate and adversarially check the next proof, and iterate. Mark the task done only when a correct proof resolves the requested AK(3) claim; otherwise continue or report a genuine external blocker without closing the research goal.
